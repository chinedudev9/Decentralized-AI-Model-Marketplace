# Decentralized-AI-Model-Marketplace
A marketplace where developers can publish their AI models (e.g., for NLP, vision), and others can use them by paying in tokens. Smart contracts manage licensing and usage tracking.

Technologies:
1. AI: Hugging Face models, custom APIs
2. Blockchain: Solidity for licensing smart contracts
3. Tokenization: ERC-20 or ERC-721
4. Frontend: Next.js

This project showcases an end-to-end platform integrating AI IP protection and monetization using blockchain.
